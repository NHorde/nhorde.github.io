Lichess Analysis
===

I learned chess when I was 8 and started playing regularly after I graduated from college. Being a huge fan of [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/NHorde) which is completely open-source and free, I decided to spend more time analyzing my games to improve my weaknesses. This [project](https://github.com/NHorde/lichess-nhorde-analysis) is based on the free [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api). 

At a high level, I am parsing all my games from a json format to .csv and then read, analyze and create some visualizations using pandas and seaborn in Python.
